# Solutions

**Recursive Depth-First Search**
Time complexity: `O(2^n)`. 
Space complexity: `O(1)`.

`2^n` is the height of a tree.

**Recursive Depth-First Search using a Hashmap**
Time complexity: `O(n)`.
Space complexity: `O(n)`.

**Fibonacci series**
Time complexity: `O(n)`.
Space complexity: `O(1)`.
